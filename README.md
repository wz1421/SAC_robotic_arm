# SAC_robotic_arm
This tutorial on implementing a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm for a robotic arm was created by MATLAB. All content and rights are owned by MATLAB. Small modifications were made to the parameters, and edits were made to the code for more data visualisation of the training by me.
